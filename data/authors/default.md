Hey, I'm Akshat. I also go by the alias of humancalico across the internet. I'm
an open source developer who likes using Rust and Nix.

When I'm not nagging my friends to use Nix you'll probably find me listening to
a comedy album or watching a mentally degenerating Adam Sandler movie.

If you have a question, a suggestion or just want to say hi you can message me
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/humancalico) or email at
[humancalico@disroot.org]() I'd love to hear from you.
